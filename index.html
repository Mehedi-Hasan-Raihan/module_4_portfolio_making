            <h3>DevOps Engineer</h3>
            <p>Hi! I’m Riad Afridi Shibly. I’ve studied Mechanical Engineering at Khulna University of Engineering and Technology, Khulna.

                Even though I’ve studied mechanical engineering, I have a keen interest in computer science. Currently, I’m working as a Software Engineer at Evatix</p>

            <h2>Skillsets</h2>
            <p>In my Day Job, I mostly work with Golang and JavaScript/TypeScript. I love golang because of its simplicity and readability. I’ve experience building REST APIs, writing server automation tools, writing parsers for configuration files, configuring build systems using docker. I’ve also experience with frontend frameworks like React, svelte and solidjs. For CSS I prefer tailwindcss. I love the tailwind design system.<br>
                <br>
                <br>

                Other than programming, I’m very familiar with Linux servers, especially Debian-based ones. I’ve configured and deployed sites using Nginx.
                
                I prefer writing elegant, readable and testable code following the best practice and the community guidelines of the programming language</p>
                <br>

        <p>Loop is a Control Engineering Club of KUET. Every year LOOP arranges two workshops to cover the minimum topics required for an engineering student to start with programming, robotics, control engineering, and industrial automation. Students who are not from the CSE dept. often find programming ambiguous. Loop is dedicated to giving them a top-level overview of all these topics.</p>
